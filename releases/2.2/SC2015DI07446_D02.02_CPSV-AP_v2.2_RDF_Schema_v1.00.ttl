However, this simple structure does not allow statements to be made about those participants, such the start and end date of a contract, nor does it support the inclusion of other roles. The Participation class supports this extra complexity if required, for instance, the description of a service user or a service provider. The model is consistent with the CPOV which in turn is based on the W3C Organization Ontology that supports the common cases simply but allows the complex cases where necessary. The Participation class can be mapped to the Organization Ontology’s Membership class that allows more complex relationships and richer metadata to be applied to a role filled by a given Agent."@en ;
