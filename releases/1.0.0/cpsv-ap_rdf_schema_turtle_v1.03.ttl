An Application Profile  is a specification that re-uses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used."@en ;

A number of EU countries have already implemented an ID (a UUID) in their address register/gazetteer, among them Denmark. It is the address identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the core vocabulary. The identifier is a hook that can be used to link the address to an alternative representation, such as vCard."@en .

The full identification of the locator could include one or more locator designators. In simpler terms, this is the building number, apartment number, etc. It is characteristic that these designators, according to tradition or to a specific set of rules, are assigned systematically. For example address numbers are most often assigned in ascending order with odd and even numbers on each side of the thoroughfare. Another example is the floor identifier that in a standardized way expresses on which level the address is located . The key difference between a locator designator and a locator name is that the latter is a proper name and is unlikely to include digits."@en .

The locator name could be the name of the property or complex, of the building or part of the building, or it could be the name of a room inside a building.
