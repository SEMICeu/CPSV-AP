The Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) is a data model that has been developed in the context of a Working Group for describing public services.

Public services are described in a structured and machine-readable way by standardising the semantics. Public administrations and service providers can in turn use this approach to describe their services and guarantee a level of cross-domain and cross-border interoperability at European, national and local level.
